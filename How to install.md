Hey Welcome to Scripts for custom Community dev menus


Guide to installing the scrips

1: Make sure the files under `vscripts` isn't removing code from the main scrips (i'll update them if those files get change in the live/main build) <https://github.com/Mauler125/scripts_r5>
2: If they don't removing code from the main scrips then you can just move `vscripts` and `weapons` into `\platform\scripts` without any problem, if they removing code from the main scrips then you have to manually change the code
3: Then you should be ready to go, remember you need to have the dev version and `sv_cheats 1` active
4: Have fun
